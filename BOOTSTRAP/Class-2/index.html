              Monkey D. Luffy, also known as Straw Hat Luffy, and later on Joy Boy and Sun God Nika, is the main
              protagonist of the One Piece franchise. The captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy seeks to find the One
              Piece treasure and become the King of the Pirates. He is also the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of
              Monkey D. Garp and the adoptive younger brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.

              He is one of the twelve "Worst Generation Pirates", due to his actions against the World Government.
              Following Kaido and Big Mom's respective defeat, Luffy was officially declared to be an Emperor of the Sea
              of the current generation, alongside with his role model, Shanks, and his rivals, Blackbeard, and Buggy
              the
              Clown.

              His first wanted bounty was 30,000,000 Berries, after defeating Buggy, Don Krieg, and Arlong in the East
              Blue Saga. Following his achievement in defeating Kaido and Big Mom in the Wano Country Arc, his bounty
              got
              increased to 3,000,000,000 Berries.

              He is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka in the anime series and Urara Takano in the OVA, in Japanese. He was voiced
              by
              Erica Schroeder in 4Kids' dub, by Chuck Powers in Odex's dub, and currently Colleen Clinkenbeard in
              Funimation's dub, in English.

                Roronoa Zoro, better known as the “Pirate Hunter Zoro” is a fighter of the Straw Hat Pirates, and a
                Senior
                Officer of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Zoro is the first crew member to join the Straw Hat Pirates, and
                is
                a right-hand man to Luffy. He is one of the Straw Hats' top four fighters by strength. He hails from the
                Shimotsuki Village at East Blue.
                When Zoro was 8 years old, his mother had already passed away from illness. His father had already been
                murdered in a battle against pirates threatening the Village, leaving Zoro alone in a dojo in Shimotsuki
                Village where he learned how to use a sword.
                He promised his late childhood companion Kuina that he would one day become the finest swordsman in the
                world, and he developed the Three Sword Style while receiving early training in Shimotsuki Village.
                Today,
                he is a master of it.

                Sanji, better known as “Black Leg Sanji” is a chef and combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of
                the
                Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is a member of the Monster Trio in the crew alongside
                Luffy and Zoro. Sanji hails from North Blue, and is a former prince of the Germa Kingdom.
                He is the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family, whom he despised since childhood. Sanji
                escaped during one of the Germa Kingdom’s expeditions to conquer North Blue, and has disowned them
                since.
                Eventually, after facing hardships and a life near death, he became a sous chef under Zeff at the
                Baratie,
                a sea floating restaurant.
                Sanji joined the Straw Hat Pirates as its fifth member. He dreams of finding the All Blue, a place which
                is rumored to be a chef’s paradise, and where wildlife from East Blue, North Blue, West Blue, and South
                Blue meet, hence the name.

                Jinbe, better known as “Knight of the Sea,” is a whale shark fish-man and a great master of Fish-Man
                Karate. His ultimate goal is to accomplish Captain Fisher Tiger's final desire: for humans and fishmen
                to
                live in peace and equality. He was a member of the Sun Pirates. After Tiger, their first captain, passed
                away, he rose to the position of second captain.
                Currently, Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and Senior Officer of the Straw Hat Grand
                Fleet.
                Before the timeskip, he was one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and also a former captain of the Sun
                Pirates. He allied with Luffy during the Impel Down arc.
                Jinbe made friends with Monkey D. Luffy before and during the war at Marineford, and two years later,
                joined forces with him and his crew to stop the New Fish-Man Pirates from overthrowing the Neptune Royal
                Family of the Ryugu Kingdom. Jinbe held off Luffy's invitation to join the Straw Hat Pirates after that
                until he severed his relationship with Big Mom Pirates during the Whole Cake Island Arc. He officially
                returned to the Straw Hat Pirates during the Wano Country arc.

                Nami, better known as “Cat Burglar Nami'', is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of the
                Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She was born in the Conomi Islands in the East Blue, where
                she and her sister Nojiko were rescued by Bell-mère, who at the time was a Marine Officer. Bell-mère
                became their adoptive mother and raised the two girls in Cocoyasi Village.
                Since she was a child, Nami was well-versed with the art of drawing maps. After Arlong killed Bell-mère
                and took over Cocoyasi Village, Nami’s life took a different turn and she decided to purchase back the
                village from Arlong. This feat compelled her to turn into a thief stealing treasures and cash. However,
                Arlong never intended to keep his word, and betrayed Nami. Ultimately, Luffy defeated Arlong, freeing
                Nami
                which also allowed the villagers to live in peace.
                Nami is the second member to join the Straw Hat crew. She traveled with Luffy and Zoro to some islands
                before ditching them at Baratie, and heading towards the Cocoyasi Village. She joined back the Straw
                Hats
                after Arlong’s defeat.
                Nami aspired to draw the map of the entire world since she was a child. Sailing through the seas, she
                has
                continued to draw maps of every region/island the crew came across. After the time-skip, Nami also
                became
                skilled in the knowledge of various weather conditions on the oceans.

                After extensive training, Brook could take control of others too and he joined the Straw Hats crew after

                Usopp, better known as “God Usopp,” is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, and a Senior Officer in the
                Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the third member to join the crew, and fourth member overall. He was
                offered to join the crew after helping the Straw Hats defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates. Usopp
                aspires to become a brave warrior of the sea someday.



                Usopp’s parents are Yasopp and Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village.Usopp dreams of
                becoming a brave sea warrior like his father despite his usual cowardice. Yasopp sailed off with
                "Red-Haired" Shanks' crew while still married and with a young son.



                Usopp started to make up the pirate stories when his mother fell sick, and continued this practice after
                her death to cope with the pain of having lost both parents. Ironically, some of his stories were shown
                to be true in the series.

                Nico Robin is the sixth member to join the Straw Hats crew. She is the archeologist of the crew. She is
                known as the 'Devil Child' due to the fact that her mother researched the Blank Era. She left the crew
                temporarily as she thought that she'll bring them harm during Enies Lobby but rejoined them in Water 7.



                When she was just a child, Robin ate the Hana Hana Devil fruit which gave her the ability to reproduce
                any of her body parts on any surface at will. When Ohara was destroyed, she was the only survivor left
                and is also the only one in the whole world who can read the Poneglyphs. She used to be a part of
                Baroque works but then left them after they got destroyed and joined the Straw Hats.
