    Hoisting


    It is default behaviour of Javscript
    It means to rise up/to take up 

    The normal code writing practice is:

    Declare variable
    Intialize variable 
    Use variable

    Due to hoisting we can change the way we write the code.


    Hoisting allows us to initialize and use the variables even before decalring them, because it takes up the 
    declaration of variables to the top of the code before starting the execution.



    Javascript hoists  the variables to the top of code  before execution. So automatically the variables get declared first and then 
    intialized and used

    Functions also get get hoisted

    var is hoisted


    let and const cannot be hoisted

    <!-- <script>
      demo();
      a = 10; //Initialize

      console.log(a); //Use
      //   var a; //Declare
      let a;

      function demo() {
        console.log("This is written at the end of code");
      }
    </script> -->
    <!-- 
    <script>
      "use strict";

      a = 10;
      console.log(a);
      let a;
    </script> -->
