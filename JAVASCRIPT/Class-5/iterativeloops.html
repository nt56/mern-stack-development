    <!-- 
        Iterative Loops: It is a type of control statement which is used to execute a 
                        block of code repeatedly until the given condition is valid

        
        1. do while
        syntax:

        do{
            Code to repeated
        }while(condition)

        The code is executed first and then the condition is checked.
        Due to this the code gets executed atleast once



        2. while
        syntax:
        while(condition){
            Code to be repeated
        }
        The condition is checked first and then the code is executed
        Due to this the code does not get executed at all if the conditoin is invalid


        3. for loop: 
        syntax:

        for(variable_declaration, condition, increment/decrement){
        
            Code to repeated
        
        }

    <script>
      let num = 1;
      do {
        console.log(num);
        // num++;
      } while (num < 1);

      console.log("In while loop");
      while (num < 1) {
        console.log(num);
        // num++;
      }
      console.log("In for loop");
      for (let num1 = 2; num1 <= 50; num1++) {
        console.log(num1);
        num1++;
      }
