    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Luffy is portrayed as a carefree, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite,
        often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself.
        Optimistic[32] and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be, and he often
        demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect.
        Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew.
        A capable and reliable captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence.
        During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy "enjoys playing stupid";
        Luffy responds with a mysterious smile.
        He enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew not just for their personality or appearance, but also because of his
        instinctive ability to read people.
        Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew (cook, navigator, medic, musician, and shipwright, filled by Sanji,
        Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Franky, respectively).
        At the beginning of the series, he said that he wanted at least ten crew members with abilities he felt
        necessary for his goal. Despite his carefree personality, each crew member respects him in their own way.
        [33][34] Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions, doing what he feels is right at the
        moment, even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force.
        [35] He is an extremely loyal captain, who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his
        life for the well-being of his crew.

        Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from "Red-Haired" Shanks. In his early childhood, he
        wears a
        white shirt and blue shorts. The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate
        his
        courage to Shanks and his crew.[28] He later wears a red vest, denim shorts, and sandals, before replacing his
        vest with
        a red, unbuttoned sea captain's coat[29] (revealing the X-shaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu),[30]
        and a
        yellow sash tied around his waist.[29] In an interview, Eiichiro Oda said Luffy's real-world nationality
        analogue is
        Brazilian.
