    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Zoro is confident but often acts in a very comical manner. A running gag is that he has a terrible sense of
        direction
        (being capable of getting lost even while walking in a straight line) which he is very insecure about since he
        never
        admits when he gets lost, instead always blaming someone else. While the crew is out at sea, Zoro can (usually)
        be found
        sleeping or training towards his goal of becoming the world's best swordsman. He and Sanji have a great rivalry,
        often
        resorting to fighting (both verbally and physically) over issues from minor to extreme. Zoro had never called
        Sanji by
        his name in the original Japanese manga, he uses phrases like "dumb-cook", etc. On the other side, Sanji uses
        phrases
        like marimo (moss-head). etc.

        Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido and is frequently mistaken for one.
        Unlike
        Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat Pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though
        never in
        cold blood. It is shown that Zoro enjoys fighting a strong opponent (usually left to face down the second
        strongest
        villain in each arc, as Luffy faces down the strongest). Zoro tends to retain a maniacal grin and serious glare
        when
        battling a worthy opponent.
    </p>
    <p>Zoro has a stern, serious, and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and
        exaggerated comic
        style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or
        sleeps.
        The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining a
        lookout in
        the ship's crow's nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his gym). He also likes sake, almost to
        the
        degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly high endurance and
        tolerance for
        alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar
        spaces or
        when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger and react. He is
        often
        displayed as being well aware of dangerous situations and the people around him.</p>
