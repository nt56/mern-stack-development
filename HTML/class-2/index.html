                Monkey D. Luffy, the beloved protagonist of the globally celebrated manga and anime series One Piece, is best known for
                his unwavering honesty, boundless optimism, and strong moral compass. However, fans of the series often find themselves
                questioning the moments when Luffy appears to bend the truth or outright lie. While he is not typically associated with
                dishonesty, certain instances in the story reveal that even this cheerful pirate captain isn’t immune to telling lies. <br>
                As the <strong>captain of the Straw Hats</strong>, Luffy is on a quest to find the mysterious <i>One Piece</i> treasure. The prized
                possession
                once belonged to infamous pirate <del>Gold Roger (Michael Dorman)</del>, but now that he<sup>’</sup>s been executed, Luffy has a
                chance at
                becoming the next King of the Pirates. He recruits a crew of misfits to join him onboard, including swordsman
                Roronoa Known for his signature straw hat and elastic limbs, Luffy always remains optimistic no matter the danger he
                encounters.
                With a pure heart, <strong>he easily wins over his crew</strong><sup>’</sup>s loyalty and often drives his rivals crazy. <q>He is a super
                cheerful
                guy, full of joy,</q> 
                <q>He is a great friend and he will fight for you
                and your
                dreams. He also loves to eat a lot, especially meat. That<sup>’</sup>s something that we share in common we both love to
                eat a
                lot.</q>

                <b>Zoro is a swordsman</b> , which is something that <i>immediately attracted me to his character</i>. Swords are easily the coolest
                weapons, it <sup>’</sup>s why I don<sup>’</sup>t mind the amount in Smash, and beyond that I also love <mark>Samurai</mark> and the Bushido code, which
                while Zoro isn’t a Samurai, he does embody the Bushido principles of honour and loyalty. Just ask Vivi, she knew what
                was up. But <ins>Zoro’s not just your run-of-the-mill swordsman</ins>, he<sup>’</sup>s the most unsanitary swordsman in anime, with his
                santoryu fighting style, two in hand and one in mouth. I love his three sword style, Oda managed to find a way to make
                Zoro immediately distinct from the thousands of other sword-wielders in the medium, and it instills Zoro’s character
                with Oda’s creative charm from right out of the gate. And <small>I love how much his fighting style</small> is represented throughout
                his design. Good stuff like his haramaki showcasing a more traditional Japanese fashion sensibility, especially fitting
                since it was originally used during wartimes, but I more so appreciate how much three<sup>’</sup>s influence his style. There’s
                obviously his swords, can’t wield them if he doesn<sup>’</sup>t carry them but additional touches like his earrings having three
                gold dangles or his colour palette usually being limited to three colours, helps the design stand out a lot. <br>
                <q>Granted, in manga the latter point isn’t as noticeably effective, and his later outfits don’t handle it as well, but in
                his original
                design, the colour placement is on point. When it comes to his attire, he only has three colours, white, black, and
                green.</q>

                The <cite>Straw Hat Pirates</cite> are the main focus of <strong>One Piece</strong>, and <strong>Sanji was the fourth person to join the crew</strong>.
                Sanji is an extremely talented chef who dreams of finding the All Blue, but he is also one of the strongest fighters in the series.
                He refuses to fight with his hands, so he relies on his legs instead. Sanji is quite chivalrous. In fact, <b>he refuses to
                hurt women even if they are trying to kill him.</b> Most One Piece fans think they know everything about Sanji, but they do
                not know everything about him.Most fans probably do not know that <i>Sanji's favorite food is spicy seafood pasta</i>, or that he has the ability to read any
                woman's bust, hip, and waist measurements by simply looking at them. Those same fans likely do not know that <q>Sanji is
                the second-fastest Straw Hat</q> , or that his favorite color is blue. There are, of course, other interesting facts about
                Sanji that fans may not know about.
